# Hey

If you want to serve in dev mode or build the project you have to use the thing inside "esbuild-tool-src". It's a cli build with Go, run `go build -o ../dev` inside the `esbuild-tool-src` folder to compile and use it with the following commands:

- dev build: To build inside the "dist" folder

- dev serve: To serve a dev mode site

- dev clean: To remove everything but the "index.html" file
